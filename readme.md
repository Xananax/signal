# Signal

Reactive values  
Alternatives: [flyd](https://github.com/paldepind/flyd),  [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx), or just use [Elm](elm-lang.org).

## Motivation

I wanted a way to create reactive values that would be as simple as [flyd](https://github.com/paldepind/flyd), yet typescript-compliant;
Flyd doesn't really work with the current limitations of typescript. I was also not too much on board with the API, which I found difficult to read. I love flyd and it has been a great source of inspiration, but I personally think sticking too closely to functional paradygms is counter-productive. Javascript is not Haskell, and I prefer a more fluid functional representation, which can be used by people not used to functional.

## How to use:

For now, check the examples in Signal/examples.

You can run them by running `npm start` then browsing to http://localhost:8080/

Test and doc coming soon.

# Signal

An attempt to get the most bare bones and functional reactive values.
Try as I may, it always ends up being too complex, and I'm not satisfied with the API.

This is not in any way shape or form ready for anything, it's still very much in flux.

I also wanted to get this well-integrated with typescript, which revealed really really hard.

I'll probably end up using [flyd](https://github.com/paldepind/flyd) or [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) anyway, as I do not have the means to maintain something like this repo, but I wanted to try and understand how it would conceptually work at least.

Stashing this here so I can come back to it in a year and be appalled at how bad my coding was.
